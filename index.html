        <h3>I'm a book lover, collector and dealer.</h3>
        <p>Browse my full collection here. Not everything is for sale and some things may already have left my collection, but if you're interested in a particular title, email me and I'll let you know if I still have it and am willing to let it go.</p>
        <h3>Current library statistics</h3>
        <p>I try to keep this up to date, but please be aware that if I move a book, I don't update this page in real-time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Total books:</b> 0,000</li>
            <li><b>Books with images:</b> 000 (0%)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How to order</h3>
        <p>Once you've found a book/some books that you're interested in, email me with their titles and I'll let you know if they're available. From there, we can discuss prices and shipping, etc.</p>
        <h3>International ordering</h3>
        <p>Happy to ship anywhere, but it will be your responsibility to know any special customs requirements/take care of any customs fees your package may receive. In general, it's not an issue sending to major countries and I will try to assist you throughout the process.</p>
        <h3>Quality of books</h3>
        <p>I aim to list books according to international book collecting standards. I also try to include photos for each book, to better show the condition and set your expectations as to the book you are getting. If you would like more photos taken for a particular book you are interested in, this is also possible, but may take a few days to happen.</p>
